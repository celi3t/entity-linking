### Creating and testing ways to hash the data

#### Implemented hashes so far:
* bloom filters (can test for different bitarray size and n_hashes)

#### Evaluation metrics:
For all variables:
* number of collisions
* sensitivity to typos

For names:
* also testing sensitivity of hashes to pre processing steps
* and whether pre processing steps make sense at all
